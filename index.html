    <h1>About Bibi</h1>
    <div class="right-align">
        Auntie is the younger sister of Mr. Jo, who is a kind person, so no one should treat her badly there.
      </p>
        She is my biggest motivation to stay strong and chase my dreams, even though they may seem too high to reach.
        Sometimes, I still doubt whether I can achieve them one by one.
        Auntie is also an amazing person she brought me closer to God, and because of her, I started reading devotionals
        regularly and remembering God more. She listens to my stories and helps me a lot.
        Wait for me to become successful, to be someone useful and who makes others proud, so we can travel the world together.
        Auntie always supports me in making my dream of studying and working in America come true.
        Thank you so much for helping pay for my college tuition, Auntie. 💙

    <h1>About Little B</h1>
    <div class="right-align">
        But this one is scarier! This breed is the first dog Auntie has ever owned, and he is also a cute dog.
    
      <p>
        The story began when Auntie got him because she was tricked HAHAHA! But it wasn’t a bad thing because he turned out to be really cute and kind.
        He’s also super energetic, especially when another dog passes by.
        He’s also a jealous dog! Whenever Auntie talks to us on the phone, he starts barking and biting her it’s so funny. 😂🐶
        And now he has a new little sibling named SI.
        Thank you, Little B, for taking care of Auntie and keeping her entertained there! 🐾💖

  <h1>About SI</h1>
  <div class="right-align">
      SI is a black cat. I don't know the breed, but (according to Auntie), there's a hint of gold on its nose—but it's not really visible. Tricked HAHAHA! 🤣🐱
      This cat is adorable and always plays with Little B. However, Little B loves to bother SI, and they often fight and cause chaos, which ends up entertaining Auntie. 🐶🐱💥
      I don't know much about SI, but what I do know is that it's cute and extremely clingy with Auntie.💕
